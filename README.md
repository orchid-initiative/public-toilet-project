# public-toilet-project
TBD - this is something Rhonda's generally interested in, so we should find a way to contribute.
Motivation: Seeing people’s faces when they don’t have access - makes her sad; affected by smells and stuff on public transit. Has to do with dignity, but also quality of life for everyone.

## Notes
- What work has there been on public bathrooms?
- Correlation/overlay with violence/drugs
- Lit Review - Areas of the country (or world) where there is success. (What is the metric of success?)
- Is there a ratio of income to public bathrooms?

- The book “The Sum of Us” talks about how we used to have really cool public things - pools, parks, libraries, etc.  But we keep taking them away. - Rhonda
